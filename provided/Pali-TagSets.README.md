# File Format Information

The file "Pali-TagSets.csv" provides all tags used during the tagging process.

Each line either contains the information about which kind of tag attribute will be defined next or individual values for each tag attribute.

Each piece of information is seperated by a tabulator so that we end up with a single table. This table is of the following structure:

	Column 1:	attribute type definition (if a new type definition starts) or empty
	Column 2:	attribute value or empty
